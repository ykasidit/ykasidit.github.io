Update: the <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/e920da1a-5b18-42df-82c3-907413e525fb/Nokia_Qt_SDK.html">Nokia Qt SDK</a> is released - supproting Ubuntu GNU/Linux!

<p>
Probably in the start of 2010, we might start having official support for Symbian C++ development on GNU/Linux (and probably Qt for S60 into Qt Creator). The hint came from a post in the symbian foundation ideas page:<br/><br/>

I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Develop_Symbian_C%2B%2B_on_Linux_using_Gnupoc_and_Eclipse_CDT">gnupoc with eclipse IDE</a>&nbsp;on Ubuntu&nbsp;for a long time - although it works well, I&#39;m sure many of us using gnupoc are waiting for real and long-term full Symbian SDK and IDE support on GNU/Linux - especially after getting to learn about the beta Qt for S60 and its integration with the Qt Creator IDE. It&#39;s really great to learn about Qt and what qt-based open-source projects/communities created, and I&#39;m sure many Qt developers are happy to hear this news as well!
