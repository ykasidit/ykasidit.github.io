title: New Pebble 2.3 Rocks Harder!

<p>  A big &quot;THANK YOU!&quot; to <a href="http://www.simongbrown.com/blog/">Simon Brown</a>, the creator of &quot;Pebble&quot; java-based blogging engine. He just released the new <a href="http://pebble.sourceforge.net/">Pebble 2.3</a> - this is truly the easiest-to-setup java-based blogging engine I've ever tried. Its features are also excellently designed and very powerful. </p>
<p> I installed the new release on my blog and found that it loads MUCH FASTER than the 2.2 - probably because &quot;Added a GZIP compression filter to reduce page loading times.&quot; as described by Simon in his blog. I was feeling that the 2.2 was loading too slow, now I'm very happy that this new release solved that problem - loads much faster! </p>
<p> <strong>Tips for Apache Tomcat 6 Users:</strong> <br />
When you install the &quot;pebble.war&quot; to your tomcat server, you can rename it as &quot;blog.war&quot; (to automatically set its path to /blog on your site) and upload it to the &quot;$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps&quot; path, then restart your tomcat server. <br />
<br />
Another way is to simply use the tomcat application manger to deploy your &quot;blog.war&quot; via its web-interface which is normally at &quot;www.yourdomain.com/manager/html&quot; - you don't have to restart your server this way. <br />
<br />
Please remember to copy the &quot;.jar&quot; files from the &quot;lib&quot; folder which came in the pebble-2.3.zip to your $TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ folder. </p>
