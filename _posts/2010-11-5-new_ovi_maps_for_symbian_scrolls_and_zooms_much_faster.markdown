title: New Ovi Maps for Symbian Scrolls and Zooms much faster
category: howto

The new Nokia Ovi maps for S60 phones scrolls and zooms much faster than older versions.

<big>*[Download it here](http://maps.nokia.com/services-and-apps/ovi-maps/downloads)*</big>

The old version on my Nokia 5230 was really slow/lagging frame by frame slow motion when you scroll/drag/zoom especially in urban places - very annoying. This new one seems to draw only the main routes while scrolling and then draws the detailed parts after the user has stopped scrolling, that's probably a part of how its scrolling got much faster. 

It seems to be much more usable now. Just downloaded the sis installer from the link above to my [Ubuntu 10.10](http://www.ubuntu.com) computer then I right-click the downloaded the sis file then send-to bluetooth - to my phone - worked well.
