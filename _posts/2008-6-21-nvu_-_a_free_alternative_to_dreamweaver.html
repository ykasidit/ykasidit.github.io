<p> I came to realize that many people I met needed a free and easy way to edit simple html files for their websites. Nvu has always been my suggestion - I use it regularly myself on both Windows and Ubuntu linux. <br />

(My <a href="http://www.clearevo.com">ClearEvo.com</a> site is maintained using Nvu, but this blog is powered by <a href="http://pebble.sourceforge.net/">Pebble</a>!) <br />
