See <a href="http://www.officeorganix.com/Chairsit.htm">this article about how to sit in a chair</a>. <br />
<br />
The middle of the page has a good &quot;<strong><font face="Arial">If       you experience this problem</font></strong>&quot; - &quot;<font face="Arial"><strong>Caused       by:</strong></font>&quot; - &quot;<font face="Arial"><strong>Try       this:</strong></font>&quot; table.<br />
<br />
In my case I was looking for the &quot;<font size="2"><strong>Neck       tension, tightness, upper back and shoulders tension.</strong></font>&quot; case and the solution seems to relieve the situation very effectively.<br />
<br />
I would also like to add that the pillow you use to sleep on also plays a significant role about neck pain too. I remember once I had a severe neck pain until I can't even sleep well then I changed my pillow and it significantly helped.
