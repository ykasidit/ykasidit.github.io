title: Make ubuntu a bit faster
category: howto
---

Update: Using "openbox" would be much faster than the "metacity" settings as in this post, see [Replace Metacity with Openbox in this page](http://www.pelagodesign.com/blog/2009/07/21/how-to-make-ubuntu-linux-run-faster-on-a-laptop/)

Found this tip somewhere in ubuntuforums, simply press alt-f2, type gconf-editor, then on the left navigate to apps > metacity > general then on the right check the "reduced resources" check box.

For those who want their ubuntu computer fast, responsive. Remember to turn-off the visual effects in apperance preferences for best speed.
