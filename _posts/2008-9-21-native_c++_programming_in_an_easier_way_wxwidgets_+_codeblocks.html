title: Native C++ programming in an easier way wxWidgets + CodeBlocks
category: programming
---
<p> I'd really like to express my thanks to the whole wxWidgets.org community for such a great open-source cross-platform framework.  <br />
<br />
I see that some famous software that are native across platforms, like <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC media player</a> and <a href="http://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a> are using wxWidgets too! <br />
<br />
Although it's not that easy to start like the commercial or non-native frameworks for application programming, I would say wxWidgets does many things so well that it seems to be far better than coding MFC. Also, <strong>with Code::Blocks IDE's integrated wxSmith - you even have a drag-and-drop GUI enabled IDE</strong>. Special thanks to the <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks IDE</a> team!!! <br />
<br />
wxWidgets is not only a GUI framework, it's a really complete programming framework: wxWidget's really helps many programming tasks: wxString string class (like CString in MFC), auto free allocated memory on exit of block (wxON_BLOCK_EXIT1), threading (wxThread), and many many more are very very useful. I even use these stuff in the console apps I made at work! <br />

The wxBook is very helpful in clearing things up and giving you a solid foundation, big-picture of things, strengths/limits, and how to use things: <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/book/">wxBook Page</a> </p>
