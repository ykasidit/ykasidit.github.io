title: Make Ubuntu programs launch much faster with Preload
category: howto
---

Use "preload" to make your Ubuntu GNU/Linux desktop computer much more responsive - programs launch much faster. "Preload" monitors what apps you normally use often and it would pre-load them to memory and thus makes them launch much faster. 

**I mean REALLY faster** - see comparison graphs in this detailed article: <http://www.techthrob.com/2009/03/02/drastically-speed-up-your-linux-system-with-preload/>

Howto use install:
- type in a terminal `sudo apt-get install preload`.
- restart your computer - preload would start monitoring what programs you use often.

Thanks to [Behdad Esfahbod](http://behdad.org/) - the author of "preload" - **it really makes the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) in my computer run blazing fast across the savannah of freedom!**
