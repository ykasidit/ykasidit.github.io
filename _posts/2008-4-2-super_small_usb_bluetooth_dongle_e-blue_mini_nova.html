I was walking in an IT accessories store and spotted this very small USB Bluetooth dongle - bought it right away. Let me write a small review for it... <br />

The main thing I like about it is that it's very small! It doesn't bother the space of other USB devices, you just plug it in and leave it there. <br />
<br />
As for performance, it seems to have very good response time, great multi-connection handling: You can use your Bluetooth Stereo Headset (I'm using an i-Tech BlueBand) at great sound quality and send files to your mobile at the same time - although the file transfer speed would drop in this scenario and the music would pause once on the start of the file transfer (but music runs fine during file transfer) - it seems to be much faster and better performing that other USB Bluetooth dongles which I tried.  <br />
<br />
As it runs on a Broadcom/WIDCOMM Bluetooth stack/driver, it worked perfectly with <a href="http://www.clearevo.com/wmousexp/">WMouseXP - Bluetooth Wireless Presenter Mouse + Media Player Remote Control Software</a> (For Nokia/S60/Moto/SE Phones). <br />
<br />
It comes with a CD driver for you to install the Broadcom/WIDCOMM Bluetooth stack, if you just plug it in then it won't work with the Microsoft Plug and Play Bluetooth stack. You must install its CD driver. The CD driver I got didn't have auto-run, you should go to 'My Computer' browse its folders (choices are for Windows XP or Vista, etc...) then run the Setup.exe . <br />

If you're interested, the e-blue mini nova official site is <a href="http://www.e-blue.jp/en/Product/ViewProduct.aspx?Ser_Id=309&amp;Cat_ID=9">HERE</a> but there seems to be no &quot;Buy&quot; link there... but you can easily Google for it. Checkout your local IT store, maybe they have it!
