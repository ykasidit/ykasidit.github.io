<p>This is amazing news:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Carbide.c++ Version 2.0.  In addition to new features and improvements, Carbide.c++ will have an entirely new licensing model - All Carbide.c++ 2.0 Editions (Developer, Professional and OEM) and licenses are now available for FREE!&quot;</em></p>
<p>This means the on-device debug - which is of huge help to save time - especially in difficult situations are now FREE for everyone. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Got to check this out:</strong></p>

<p>Really happy to hear that a lot more people working hard on Symbian C++ can debug over Bluetooth and save lots of time! <br />

<p>I was using on-device debug for nearly a year now (the company I work for bought it - it was not free in the past) for my job - it really saved lots and lots of time. Probably never used the emulator ever since.</p>
