<p> I was very happy when I came to know about FileZilla - finally a simple, stable and free Ftp client. I hope this suggestion benefit others too... <br />

If you're using Windows, just download and run the installer from the page above. <br />

As for Ubuntu Linux, the easier way to install is to simply find, check the box and click apply - from the Add/Remove software manager. </p>
