For LCD screens:<br />
<br />
1. Simply open &quot;System&quot; -&gt;&quot;Preferences&quot;-&gt;&quot;Appearance&quot; then choose the &quot;Font&quot; tab then select &quot;Subpixel smoothing (LCDs)&quot; <br />
<br />
2. Now, your fonts might grow too big - so press the &quot;Details...&quot; button and set the resolution to 90 dots per inch (default is 96) changes would apply when your press enter or when you use the increase/decrease button.<br />
<br />
That's it! Notice the difference.&nbsp; Some apps might need restart to be affected.
