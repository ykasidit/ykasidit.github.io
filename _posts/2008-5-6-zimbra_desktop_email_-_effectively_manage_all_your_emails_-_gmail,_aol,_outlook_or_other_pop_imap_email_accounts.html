title: ZIMBRA Desktop email - effectively manage all your emails - Gmail, AOL, Outlook or other POP/IMAP email accounts
category: howto

<p> I've been trying lots of (free) email clients lately both in Ubuntu Linux and Windows... As for now, my favorite is: <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop.html"> <img src="http://www.clearevo.com/blog/files/zdesktopubuntu.png" alt="" /> </a> <br />
(This picture is its icon on my Ubuntu desktop) <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop.html"><strong>Zimbra Desktop</strong></a> - you get all your emails in one place, very smart highlighting (For example, when you hover your mouse on some &quot;today&quot; in a message - Zimbra shows what day was that... etc.). It seems to work well and stable with lots of mail in the inboxes. Best of all, it's really smart and <strong>SUPER EASY to setup new email accounts</strong> (I used gmail-based company acoounts). I never found any email client that is this easy to setup accounts, you always had to enter repetitive things, ports, etc. <br />
<br />
Yes, I love the simplicity that comes from &quot;convention over configuration&quot;. (If you're a programmer then maybe you heard that phrase recently? <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">No?</a>) <br />
<br />
For <strong>Windows</strong> it's super easy to install Zimbra: just download and run the installer. <br />
<br />
For <strong>Ubuntu Linux</strong>, a little harder to install (but that's normal in Linux). Here's a small <strong>HOWTO install Zimbra Desktop on Ubuntu</strong>: <br />
<br />
1. Download Zimbra desktop for linux (browse from <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop.html"> Zimbra Desktop official page</a>) to your home folder. <br />
<br />
( in your terminal, where you downloaded the installer for linux...) <br />
2. <strong>chmod +x zdesktop*</strong> <br />
<br />
3. <strong>sh zdesk*</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
I used to like/use the embedded email client that <a href="http://www.opera.com"><strong>Opera Internet browser</strong></a> provided, but I had problems about its strage behaviors with IMAP (with my gmail account - I recall that it showed sent messages in inbox, etc...), and in POP3 mode - I also observed a few cases when some new big sized emails get lost when there are lots of messages in its Inbox... Not using it anymore now. <br />
<br />
As for my Ubuntu Linux boot, I always liked/preferred its default email client - Evolution (and still like/use it now...). However, sometimes (OK, many times) it seems to hang/freeze for a few seconds, makes you feel in danger of a system hang - but no - just the Evolution froze a few secs. Other instabilities I found included a case where the program froze with the CPU in full usage and got hot, and a sometimes it just hanged - needed to kill the process. But those things are rare, not a real problem. Evolution would still be the number-one and most complete linux-based email client in my mind. <br />
<br />
I also tried Thunderbird - it's good, fast, but it had difficulties in using multiple outgoing email accounts, it doesn't seem to be designed for using many email accounts in one place... especially about the sending smtp settings.<br />
