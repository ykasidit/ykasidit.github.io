(A simple version of &quot;Indian tea&quot; is boiling the tea in milk rather than water)<br />
<br />
<strong>Prevent milk from being burnt at the bottom of your tea pot</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Simple</strong> - put your milk tea pot to boil inside another larger pot with some water - just enough water to cover about one third of your tea pot! <br />
<br />
How it works - Once the water in the outer tea pot comes to boil - the water temperature is regulated naturally between its liquid and steam state so the bottom of your milk tea pot doesn't get too hot.<br />
<br />
This same &quot;2 pot&quot; method can be used for cooking food/rice dishes with no bottom burns.
