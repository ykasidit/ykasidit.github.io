Update: the [Nokia Qt SDK](http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/e920da1a-5b18-42df-82c3-907413e525fb/Nokia_Qt_SDK.html) is released - supproting Ubuntu GNU/Linux!

After waiting and using [unofficial tools like gnupoc with eclipse cdt to develop native Symbian C++ applications](http://www.clearevo.com/blog/programming/2009/06/05/symbian_c%2B%2B_on_linux_using_gnupoc_and_eclipse_cdt.html) for a long while. Finally, the symbian foundation and Nokia's Qt seem to start going towards official tools for development on GNU/Linux - see these two articles:
