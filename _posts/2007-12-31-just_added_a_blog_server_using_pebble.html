Want to have your own blog hosted on your web-server in minutes? Pebble is the answer! 

<p>
You don't even have to do any database stuff since it stores data in xml files. Just deploy the .war file and DONE!
<p>
It's sooooooo easy to setup and use (I'm using an Apache Tomcat 6 app server),
<p>
Just open up <a href="http://pebble.sourceforge.net/">Pebble official site</a> and Enjoy!
