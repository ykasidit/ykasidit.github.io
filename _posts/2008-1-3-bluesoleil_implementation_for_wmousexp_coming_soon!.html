title: BlueSoleil implementation for WMouseXP coming soon!
category: howto
---
<p>
Many USB Bluetooth dongles nowadays comes with BlueSoleil driver CD.
<p>
The upcoming <a href="http://www.clearevo.com/wmousexp/">WMouseXP</a> 2.0 would support using BlueSoleil too! (The current WMouseXP 1.2 only supports Microsoft and Broadcom Bluetooth driver/stacks...) I expect this to be released within 1 month's time.
