I tried a few to-do list manager apps in the past but always had to revert to my simple text file TODO.txt method because my needs can't be sufficed:<br />
<br />
1. Easily/instantly add TODOs - don't ask/force me to put the end-dates, priority, etc.<br />
2. Easily/instantly re-order the list - move the more important ones up according to the situation.<br />
3. Easily/instantly move the TODOs that were DONE down at the bottom of the list for future reference - but not delete them.<br />
<br />
Finally, I found this ta-da list to meet my demands and it's on-line so it's better than transferring my TODO.txt here and there and sometimes forget which copy is latest! It also has multiple lists so you can group up the TODOs.<br />
<br />
Ta-da List seems very simple and easy to use with the least annoyance of regular todo list managers, plus this is on-line: a centralized place to keep your lists:<br />
