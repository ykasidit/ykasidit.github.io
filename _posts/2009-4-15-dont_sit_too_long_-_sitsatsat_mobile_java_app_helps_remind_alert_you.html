title: Don't sit too long - SitSatSat mobile java app helps remind/alert you
category: howto
---
<p> I have this neck pain problem myself and made this little j2me (for java-enabled phones) app long ago - to remind every 20 minuts with an alert sound:<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.getjar.com/products/1749/SitSatSat">SitSatSat (FREE)</a></strong><br />
<br />
I forgot about it for so long until recently my neck pain increased.<br />
<br />
I tried different chairs, sitting positions, but none solved the problem if you still <strong>sit for too long</strong> without moving periodically. The neck pain was much less during holidays or days I didn't sit coding.<br />
<br />
So I remembered this SitSatSat app, searched for it (I remember I deployed it on GetJar.com long ago), installed it on my current development phone: Nokia 6120 - <strong>stand up, move your neck in all directions when it alerted</strong> - it helped reduce my neck pain a lot at the end of the day. <br />
<br />
The main thing is that the alerting app actually can't help you at all, you need to help yourself: move you neck, stand up regularly when it alerts. Just keep in mind that <strong>&quot;your health is important too!&quot;</strong>. </p>
