Ever wondered how much you are worth? How to increase your value?

Let's consider general products/goods, hardware, cars, fruits, food:

 - Generally, things that are highly priced or highly valued are those which can provide high values/benefit to its user.

Simply, the observation is: 

 - You're "value" is in how much you are of doing "good"/benefit to others. 
 - The more you give, the more you get - taken wisely, that is how much you are worth both in the practical and spiritual sense.
 - Do more good/benefit to others - in family, work, community, etc - to increase your value. 

Natural physics law considerations:

 - You get back what you give: We see the natural laws govering the universe about "force" - as understood and summarized by "Newton's 3rd law" - we put our weight on our chair, our chair pushes back to us equally so we can sit.

 - Your "value" or work is never lost: As with "the law of conservation of energy" - energy is never lost - it just changes form. Similarly, in the ethical sense - the "value" you do is never lost too.


Peace and Happiness.
