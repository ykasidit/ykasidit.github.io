title: Try a faster web-browser - The new Opera 9.5
category: howto

<p> A new hairstyle would probably make you feel a lot different. What about trying a new browser? Try this: <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.opera.com/"><img height="250" width="300" alt="Opera 9.5 - beautifully engineered" src="http://files.myopera.com/EspenAO/albums/548363/kestrel_300x250.jpg" /></a> <br />
<br />
Yes, for me it's faster. Feels much more response. Looks new and very intuitive. <br />
<br />
I really love the speed-dial feature too - just add your favorite sites you go often there and just speed-dial it - like on a phone! (Maybe because Opera is from Norway, near Nokia in Finland and Ericsson in Sweden?) <br />
<br />
Speaking about mobile phone's - don't forget to try their famous <strong><a href="http://www.operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a></strong> too! <br />
<br />
Have a nice &amp; fresh new day! </p>
