category: howto
---
<p> For some strange reason, the restrictred hardware drivers that used to work for installing the nvidia drivers on ubuntu freezed/hanged on two computers i tried already. So I somehow found this useful. <br />
<br />
Open the Accessories &gt; Terminal and enter  <br />
<br />
sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-177 <br />
<br />
Then <br />
<br />
sudo nvidia-xconfig <br />
<br />
Then, make sure all work is saved, all other programs are closed, press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to restart the window server. Hope this helps.     </p>
