Some people don't like to eat egg-plants because its little bitter taste.<br />
<br />
The technique to reduce/remove the bitterness I found in a Turkish cookbook is to cut the egg-plants and put them in salt-water for about 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
I dont remember how much salt but I think I put enough salt to make the water quite salty.<br />
<br />
After the time, you will see the water color change to be darker. Remove the egg-plants from the brine and wash them with plain water, squeeze the salt water out too.<br />
<br />
Maybe this tip is one reason why there are so many Turkish egg-plant recipe/dishes!
