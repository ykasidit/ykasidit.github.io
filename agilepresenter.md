5. Start your Powerpoint/Presentation on computer.

6. Open you're phone's browser to the specified URL in AgilePresenter running on your computer...

Remote control your presentation from phone!

*NOTE: If nothing shows up on phone*
- Make sure your firewall is not blocking port 80
- Try using another URL by entering the `http://<IP of your computer>`:
	- Right-click your currently connected connection > Status > Support and use that IP.
	- Or
	- Go to Start > Run ... > cmd.exe > ipconfig - read for the IP of your WIFI connection - mostly in the form of 192.168.1.xx
