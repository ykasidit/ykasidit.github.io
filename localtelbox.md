Setup instructions
------------------

**LocalTelBox**

- **IP Configuration**: LocalTelBox defaults to using the IP address '192.168.1.2' in your WIFI network - if your modem/router uses the IP '192.168.1.1' and the DHCP 'starting' IP is not 192.168.1.2 then this should be fine.

You can check the IP of your modem/router, by connecting your PC to the desired WIFI network, then open a 'command prompt' (in Windows) and type 'ipconfig'.

If you're an advanced user who wants to set the static IP of your LocalTelBox yourself, please email us at **`<`support[AT]clearevo.com`>`**.

**Android**

**Windows PC**
