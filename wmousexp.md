<big><big>**2**</big></big> - **Make sure your computer/notebook's Bluetooth is ON and paired with your phone.** *(If your computer does not have Bluetooth then you can get a cheap USB Bluetooth dongle, preferably one which comes with a Broadcom driver.)*

<a id="pair_bt"/>**Here's how to "pair" your phone's Bluetooth with your computer's or notebook's Bluetooth:**

  - 2.1 Open phone's Bluetooth Settings, set visibility to "Discoverable" so that it can be discovered from PC.
    - **Nokia:** Go to Menu > Settings > Connectivity > Bluetooth > My phone's visibility = "Show to all" or "Define period" as in screenshot below. (Setting to "Hidden" would cause the connect or search/pair to fail!)
      - ![nokia_bt_set_temporary_visible](nokia_bt_set_temporary_visible.jpg)
    - **Android:** On home screen, press the "settings" button (the "3 stripes" button on bottom of screen) and choose "Settings" > Wireless and Networks > Bluetooth > Check the "Visible" or "Discoverable" box.

  - 2.2 Start pairing from PC - On Computer: right-click on the Bluetooth icon in the bottom-right system-tray and choose "Add a new Bluetooth device" - or go to the Bluetooth settings in Control Panel and select "Add".
    - ![Add a Bluetooth Device](ss/add_bt_dev.gif)
    - Follow the steps as per your computer's Bluetooth software, you can normally choose an easy numeric pass-code, like 0000, then your phone would notify and ask you to enter/confirm that code, then the pairing would be done.

<big><big>**3**</big></big> - **[Click here to Download WMouseXP "PC App"](WMouseXP2_3Installer.exe)** - install on computer, start it. 

  - Get your phone's "WMouseXP Mobile ID" shown in your mobile app (this is actually your phone's Bluetooth address) - Enter it into the PC app, then press the "Connect" button. Done!
  - ![WMouseXP Mobile ID from phone app](ss/nokia_install_WMouseXP_presenter_remote9.jpg) ![Start and enter WMouseXP mobile ID](ss/pc_side.png)

Connect failed?
--------------

**This is normally because the phone wasn't paired with your computer's Bluetooth yet.** Simply follow the [steps above to pair with PC](#pair_bt). 

If things still don't work, you can lastly try setting the Bluetooth visibility to "Show to all" as in below screenshot, then try press connect from WMouseXP on PC again.

![WMouseXP j2me bluetooth remote](WMouseXP_j2me_bluetooth_remote.gif)

- 1: Exit the presentation (Esc, use while in Powerpoint*).
- 2: Previous slide (Page Up, use while in Powerpoint*).
- 3: Start presentation (F5, use while in Powerpoint*).
- 4: Launch "My Computer".
- 5: Launch Media Player.
- 6: Mute/Unmute.
- 7: Stop.
- 8: Play/Pause.
- 9: Increase Volume.
- *: Previous Track.
- 0: Next Track.
- \#: Decrease Volume.

*Notes:*
* WMouseXP generates keyboard events as described. Therefore, it would work as described only when a presentation is already opened in Microsoft Powerpoint. Also compatible with OpenOffice.org (a free open-source alternative to Microsoft Office) presentations:  
- "My Computer" would not be launched if another "My Computer" window is alraedy open.
- Right click doesn't work on some phones, mouse speed acceleration doesn't work on some PCs. Try the FREE-TRIAL to test them on your phone/PC.

*Other Notes:*
Some media player commands may not work as intended if you have some versions of Nero or WinAmp software installed. You can check this if you have a multimedia keyboard: try pressing the "Media Player","Play","Stop","Next Track","Previous Track", "Increase Volume", "Decrease Volume" keys - you can normally expect the same results from WMouseXP. Just try the FREE TRIAL - The Best way to know if it works on your phone and PC or not.

*Known Issues:*
-The PC-Side WMouseXP used to work fine but suddenly it always show "Connection Declined or Timed-Out".
Solution: This rare error can be solved by Restarting your PC and try again.

Usage Scenarios
------------------

*Bluetooth Presentation Remote Control*

Walk around explaining your presentation on stage (or in meeting/class rooms), click the joystick of your phone to move on to the next step/slide of your presentation. Press "2" on the numpad to go to the previous one. With WMouseXP, you have wireless control of your powerpoint presentation in your hand! 

*Wireless Mobile Bluetooth Mouse*

With WMouseXP, your mobile phone can be used as a wireless mouse: move the mouse, left click, right click - all using your phone's joystick. WMouseXP generates smooth cursor movement on PC, the cursor move speed increases as you hold the joystick down. When you have control of your mouse cursor, you have wireless control of your computer.
What's better is that you don't have to use a clean surface/table like that of a real mouse. This mouse is entirely hand-held. You can use WMouseXP on your sofa, your bed, from your kitchen, virtually anywhere in the Bluetooth range - this is normally up to ten meters away! 

*Bluetooth Media Player Remote Control*

With WMouseXP, your phone becomes the remote control of your PC-based entertainment system.
Sit-back on your comfortable sofa or lay down on your bed while having full control of your Media Player from your phone - change the track, increase the volume, open your favorite movie, double click your phone's joystick to make it full-screen. Feel sleepy? Just move the cursor to your Window's "Start" button and shut-down the computer. Yes, that sounds nice. Just use WMouseXP to make all this happen.
Bluetooth signals can even go through walls, so you can even change the song in your playlist or increase the volume while you're in the bathroom! (but don't get your phone wet!)
