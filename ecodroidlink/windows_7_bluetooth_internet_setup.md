Windows 7 Bluetooth Internet Access Point Setup
=====================================

Below are the instructions and screenshots (Windows 7) to get Internet access via [EcoDroidLink Bluetooth Access Point](https://www.clearevo.com/ecodroidlink) on your Windows 7 computer. 

**The screenshots below are for "Microsoft Bluetooth Driver/Stack" - if it looks differently on your computer, this probably means you're using a "Broadcom Bluetooth Driver/Stack" - the steps are similar - just add/pair then connect to the "Network Access Point" service from "My Bluetooth Places".**

This requires Bluetooth hardware (internal or USB) for your computer (most notebooks already have it, but many desktops don't have it) - if your computer does not have Bluetooth or if it's not working properly - you can get a tested, good quality, [Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter from this link](https://www.clearevo.com/bluetooth_usb_dongle).

(These steps are the same as doing "Bluetooth tethering" - sharing internet from your phone to computer/notebook - except that if you do Bluetooth tethering, you should enable it on your phone too (Android: Settings > More... > Tethering & portable hotspot > check on the "Bluetooth tethering" box first.)

1. Click on the Bluetooth Icon in the system tray:

4. Click "Yes" then click "Next".

5. Wait for it to load, it would try to install some drivers and normally some "peripheral drivers" could fail - this is normal and unrelated to our objective of getting internet access - just ignore such failure alerts/notifications.

6. It would compelte and show that the device has been successfully added to this computer. Press Close.

Success! (If it fails to connect first time, it's normal - just try again) Now let's open your browser and browse the internet!
