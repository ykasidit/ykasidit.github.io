Windows XP Bluetooth Internet Access Point Setup
=====================================

Below are the instructions and screenshots for Windows XP to get Internet access via [EcoDroidLink Bluetooth Access Point](https://www.clearevo.com/ecodroidlink).

**The screenshots below are for "Microsoft Bluetooth Driver/Stack" - if it looks differently on your computer, this probably means you're using a "Broadcom Bluetooth Driver/Stack" - the steps are similar - just add/pair then connect to the "Network Access Point" service from "My Bluetooth Places".**

This requires Bluetooth hardware (internal or USB) for your computer (most notebooks already have it, but many desktops don't have it) - if your computer does not have Bluetooth or if it's not working properly - you can get a tested, good quality, [Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter from this link](https://www.clearevo.com/bluetooth_usb_dongle).

(These steps are the same as doing "Bluetooth tethering" - sharing internet from your phone to computer/notebook - except that if you do Bluetooth tethering, you should enable it on your phone too (Android: Settings > More... > Tethering & portable hotspot > check on the "Bluetooth tethering" box first.)

1. Go to the Start button > Control Panel:

<br/>Just wait a bit more then the name of the device would show, click on it to select, then press "Next":

<br/>Oops... It failed to connect first time - it's normal, just try again...

<br/>Ok, pressed "Connect" again, and success! You'd see the new network icon in the system tray, you can double-click it to see the status:
