Ubuntu Bluetooth Internet Access Point Setup
=====================================

Below are the instructions and screenshots (Ubuntu 12.04) to get Internet access - via [EcoDroidLink Bluetooth Access Point](https://www.clearevo.com/ecodroidlink) - on your Ubuntu computer.

This requires Bluetooth hardware (internal or USB) for your computer (most notebooks already have it, but many desktops don't have it) - if your computer does not have Bluetooth or if it's not working properly - you can get a tested, good quality, [Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter from this link](https://www.clearevo.com/bluetooth_usb_dongle).

(These steps are the same as doing "Bluetooth tethering" - sharing internet from your phone to computer/notebook - except that if you do Bluetooth tethering, you should enable it on your phone too (Android: Settings > More... > Tethering & portable hotspot > check on the "Bluetooth tethering" box first.)

1. Click the Bluetooth icon on top right of screen and select "Set Up New Device...":

4. Now press "Continue":

5. A random PIN would be shown, it doesn't matter for our case so just press "Matches".

6. Click on the checkbox "Use your phone mobile phone as a network device (PAN/NAP)". Then press "Close".

<br/>Oops, it fails to connect! It's normal - sometimes first attempts can fail... let's try again...

<br/>Ok, tried connecting again and now it's successful!

After successful connection, just try open your browser - success:
