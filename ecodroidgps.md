Accuracy and GNSS Systems
-------------------------

It is quite common to get 1.x meter accuracy in day-to-day usage - below is an example screenshot:
<br/>
<img src="images/android_using_ecodroidgps.png" alt="Android using EcoDroidGPS getting high GPS accuracy">
<br/>
<br/>
New! We now pre-configure the USB GPS Device in the kit to support Galileo GNSS - See below screenshot when use with 'GNSS Commander' app:
<img src="images/ecodroidgps_galileo_gnss_support.png" alt="EcoDroidGPS using Galileo GNSS">
<br/>

EcoDroidGPS delivers accurate positioning from the **powerful 72-channel Ublox [UBX-M8030 series GNSS chip](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/ubx-m8030-series)** featuring concurrent reception of GPS + Glonass + Galileo (Galileo support added May 2019 + Can be enabled/disabled via U-Blox U-Center PC Software via USB), and Industry leading -167 dBm navigation sensitivity.

*NOTE: For advanced users, if the M8030 in the kit is not accurate enough - the new device now supports connecting to (not provided in the kit) the Ardusimple U-Blox F9 (ZED-F9P) Dual-frequency GNSS + RTK device (customer buys it separately/directly from Ardusimple) - providing instant Bluetooth/RTK support to the u-blox F9 board (for centimeter level accuracy once RTK is active) for use with apps like the 'Lefebure NTRIP Client' or our 'Bluetooth GNSS' app.*

*Similar/alternative to the popular HOLUX, Garmin Bluetooth GPS but EcoDroidGPS is powered by a car-charger, has an external antenna and can handle up to 4 connected phones simultaneously! (If you need 6 connected devices please contact us for the older model that supports 6 but consumes more power...)*

        <h3 class="card-title">Better GPS accuracy</h3>
	EcoDroidGPS provides accurate GPS data from a real USB GPS (which is normally better than phone's internal A-GPS), powered by the advanced <a href="https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/ubx-m8030-series">ublox M8030 GNSS chips</a>.

        <h3 class="card-title">Multiple connected devices</h3>
	Unlike most Bluetooth GPS Receivers which cannot handle more than one connected phone at a time, we've tested up to 6 connected phones to one EcoDroidGPS device simultaneously and it still works well (theoretical max is 7 phones).

        <h3 class="card-title">Magnet GPS Antenna</h3>
      	Although EcoDroidGPS already works well with the antenna placed on your car's dashboard, but for even better GPS positioning, you can also mount the external antenna on your car roof (when not raining/snowing - not waterproof!)

Ideal for improving GPS accuracy and GPS position fixing in car navigation apps like Google Maps or professional GPS map plotting apps like:

  - GPS Plotting in Android DriveTest apps (mobile network radio testing - like G-MoN, G-NetTrack, AZENQOS, etc)
  - GPS Geographical data logging Android apps

Easy Setup
----------

<small><i>See below video showing the Android setup for EcoDroidGPS and using with Google Maps and G-NetTrack (location/geo logging with radio measurements) in below video</i></small>:

EcoDroidGPS is powered by a micro-usb port like most Android phones - we provide a car charger in the kit for typical in-car usage, but if your target usage is not in cars, you can also use it with most existing micro-usb phone chargers (preferably Tablet chargers) or power banks.

<small><small>*Below video clip shows the EcoDroidGPS's Bluetooth dongle's LED light (on the right) blinking continuously while connected to an Android phone. Above it is the USB cable of the USB GPS device. A micro-usb power cable connects it to the car-charger. All of these components are provided in the EcoDroidGPS kit.*</small></small>

Our own advanced Linux powered parrarel processing + multicast software inside each EcoDroidGPS unit allows up to 7 concurrent combined Android phone/tablets to receive the same GPS data concurrently and without any one device slowing other devices. All devices would get exactly the same location data.

Ideal for professional GPS map plot requirements for mobile network LTE/WCDMA/GSM DriveTests, Google Maps navigation on Android mobile phones and tablets - multiple, concurrently!


Android setup instructions
--------------------------

New! Use our 'Bluetooth GNSS' app from Google Playstore - [click here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearevo.bluetooth_gnss)!

*Alternative*

- Use with Android ‘Bluetooth GPS’ app by ‘GG MobLab’:
![Android Bluetooth GPS app for connecting to EcoDroidGPS](images/android_bluetooth_gps_app.png "Android Bluetooth GPS app"){:class="img-responsive"}
- Follow it’s on screen instructions, after you already set it as ‘Mock locations provider’ in ‘Developer Options’ which it would open for you, paired and connected to the Bluetooth GPS device, make sure in the ‘Main’ tab: ‘Lat/Lon’ shows and the ‘Date/time’ is constantly updating and in the ‘Status’ tab, the measurements should be moving constantly and the ‘Accuracy’ should be preferably less than ‘5m’ before using your target app (Google Maps or other Android GPS logging/tracking apps).
- Also make sure you go to this app’s ‘settings’ in the three-dot options menu and check/enable ‘Reconnect’.
- Although we're not using the phone's internal A-GPS in this Bluetooth GPS to Android 'mock locations' mode, but we must still make sure that 'location' services is turned on otherwise apps like Google Maps are known to have 'no location update' issues:
  - Go to Android phone's app list > Settings > Location
  - Make sure it is turned 'On'.
  - Make sure the 'Mode' is set to 'High accuracy'.
