ParkedAid 1.4 (FREE!) 
=====================

Notes your parking location picture and calculates parking time!

For the photo feature, you need a java-enabled mobile phone that supports picture capture such as most Nokia Series 40 or S60 camera phones, SonyEricsson, Motorola, etc.

If your phone doesn't have the photo feature, ParkedAid would save only the location note and parking duration.

Update 041208: Thanks to bug report by Jonathan Kung. Fixed "Help" command blocking the snap command in S40 phones.
