About      
------
Incallert periodically generates sound beeps (which are normally heard only on your side) during phone calls. Use Incallert to make you conscious of your phone calls' minute mark - at and BEFORE the minute mark - WITHOUT having to look at the phone.

While active, this program makes a beep sound at the minute mark and can also make a different beep sound before the minute mark of your call. This feature helps notify you that a new minute cycle is coming soon, useful to control your call lengths by not getting into a new minute and using just a few soconds of the whole new minute that you're charged for - especially for international or other costly calls where the cost per minute is quite high. In cases like this, you would like to set Incallert to warn at and before every minute.

It can also be useful in the case that you don't want to waste too much time on the phone - you can set Incallert to warn you every 5 or 10 minutes.

Requirements
------------
Incallert can be used on S60 3rd and 2nd Edition phones. Tested and working on Nokia E61, 6120 classic, E90.

If you want it to warn before every new minute, you should set the "Minute Alert Cycle" in the Settings to "Every Minute".
